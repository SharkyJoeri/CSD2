This is the last assignment from the CSD2a course. 

I've chosen to use a different way of creating a sequence. Instead of time dependend durations I used binary, where 1 equals a hit and 0 equals a rest. I chose this different strategy because it made more sense for me as drummer and corresponds to drum sheet music.

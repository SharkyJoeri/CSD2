This is the final assignment from the CSD2a course. 

Due to the fact that I wasn't able to get ubuntu working until 4 weeks into the course.


RANDOM GENERATION:
I've chosen to use a different way of creating a sequence. Instead of time dependend durations I used binary, where 1 equals a hit and 0 equals a rest. I chose this different strategy because it made more sense for me as drummer and corresponds to drum sheet music.

For the random generation I used polyrhythmic values for each layer of samples in a format like (KICK:SNARE:HIHAT). If I'd input (3:5:2) then the kick plays every 3 beats, the snare every 5 beats and the hihat every 2 beats. To implement some randomisation I randomly added 1 or subtracted 1 from the inputted polyrhytmic values.

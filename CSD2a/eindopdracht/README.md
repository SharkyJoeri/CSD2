This is the final assignment from the CSD2a course. 


RANDOM GENERATION:
I've chosen to use a different way of creating a sequence. Instead of time dependend durations I used binary, where 1 equals a hit and 0 equals a rest. I chose this different strategy because it made more sense for me as drummer and corresponds to drum sheet music.

For the random generation I used polyrhythmic values for each layer of samples in a format like (KICK:SNARE:HIHAT). If I'd input (3:5:2) then the kick plays every 3 beats, the snare every 5 beats and the hihat every 2 beats. To implement some randomisation I randomly added 1 or subtracted 1 from the inputted polyrhytmic values.

REFLECTION:
I had very little time left in the end to work on the actualy assignment due to the fact that I wasn't able to get ubuntu working until 4 weeks into the course. This caused some minor inconveniences in my workflow. In hindsight I would have wanted to work a bit more organised and use beter comments on every update. I hadn't worked with git or python before and didnt fully understand it at the start but slowly got more used to it over the 3 weeks I had left actually using it.

This course was very usefull for me for getting to know git, using the console and learning the python language. I really feel like I've gained a ton of knowledge in a short amount of time and I'm looking forward to the comming lessons.

I'd probably spend about 8 to 10 hours setting up virtualbox, fixing glitches and trying to get the audio to not cause errors. Another 3 to 4 hours on setting up Ubuntu on my laptop and connecting git to github. I'd probably spend about 6 to 8 hours working on the actual assigments adding to a total of 17 to 22 hours spend on CSD in the past 8 weeks.
